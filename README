This resume and coverletter template is based on a latex template[1] which had been
heavily altered.  I found myself fighting with they styling too much and wished i could
just use html to build my resume.

Luckily, I found Prince[2]. Prince is an amazing tool that converts HTML to PDFs. Since my
goal is a printed PDF, I wasn't too conernced with how clean my HTML or CSS is, however, you
may want to contribute and help refine it.

Prince puts a watermark on the top right corner of the first page if you do not have a license.
This watermark is non-printing, so print to PDF may be helpful to you (hint hint).

Sample Usage (inside the samples directory)
[path]/prince -v -ihtml resume.html -o resume.pdf
[path]/prince -v -ihtml coverletter.html -o coverletter.pdf
[path]/prince -v -ihtml references.html -o references.pdf
